Syntax: The basic syntax of the scp command is:

scp [options] [source] [destination]

Transfer: To transfer a file from the source to the destination, use the following command:

scp /path/to/local/file username@destination:/path/to/destination

Replace:
/path/to/local/file with the path to the file you want to transfer.
username with the username of the destination system.
destination with the IP address or hostname of the destination system.
/path/to/destination with the path on the destination system where you want to save the file.


For example:

scp /home/user/documents/example.txt user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/destination/
